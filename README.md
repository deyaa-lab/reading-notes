 My name is Diaa. I graduated from Yarmouk University majoring in accountancy..
 I have the desire to learn programming to develop my experiences.
## **The growth mentality indicates that success does not need intelligence, as it is known ..
 Success needs seriousness and work to reach goals and achieve success.


And the fixed mentality restricts and prevents a person from advancing and
living in a comfortable atmosphere


We can develop a fixed mindset by way of :
.Getting into challenges
.Not to lose focus when there is a problem
.Making an effort helps me to reach the goal**

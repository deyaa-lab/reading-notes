CSS 
allows you to create great-looking web pages

As we have mentioned before, CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.

A document is usually a text file structured using a markup language — HTML is the most common markup language, but you may also come across other markup languages such as SVG or XML.

CSS syntax
CSS is a rule-based language — you define rules specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page. For example "I want the main heading on my page to be shown as large red text."

Three Ways to Insert CSS
There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:

External CSS
Internal CSS
Inline CSS

CSS Syntax:

1.Set the text color with a HEX value:

   body {color: #92a8d1;}
2. Set the text color with a HSL value:

   body {color: hsl(89, 43%, 51%);}
